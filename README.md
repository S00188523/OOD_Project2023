# OOD_Project2023
this is a project for Object-Oriented-Development in Year 2, Semester 2 of software development
this project is designed to make a call and return data based off the premier league table
when the data is called, i have formatted it to be displayed in a listbox to replicate the premier league table
in the table i have displayed the stats for each team 
i also included a feature, where when a team is selected, a second window appears displaying the team name, an image of their stadium and some information and history of the club
the reason i chose to use an API is so that it can return live and up to date data on the premier league so that it can be accurate in displaying what the current standings are for the premier league in the current season
